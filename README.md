# blog
This is a Jekyll blog theme/layout I forked from Github user.
My blog made with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted with Github Pages.
Below is the README included in the original repository. The instructions for getting setup with Jekyll are pretty clear, but feel free to reach out if something doesn't make sense! I've probably stumbled over that same problem and I'm happy to help.

### TODO

* valid link for papers
* links for universities

* edit the `_config.yml` with your info
* change the links in `_data/navigation.yml`
* remove my posts from `_posts/`
* rename your repo to ***your-username*.github.io**
