I am now a graduate student at New York University, Center For Data Science. After graduated with a B.S in Statistics and a B.A in Busniess Administration from University of Science and Technology of China. I chose to continue my study about data science concentrating on Machine Learning in America. Looking forward to start a career as a data scientist in the future.

I am passionate of investigating any real life problem with tools in data mining, machine learning and statistics, especially in commercial world or behavior sciences. I consider myself as a quick learner and willing to improve myself with fundamental concepts in math and computer science. Therefore I could understand those advanced methods, even create my own to solve the questions I care about.
